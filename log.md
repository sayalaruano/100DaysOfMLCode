# 100 Days Of ML Code - Log

Hi! I am Sebasti√°n, a Machine Learning enthusiast and this is my log for the 100DaysOfMLCode Challenge.

## Day 1: September 10, 2021

**Today's Progress:** I have completed the [first week material of the mlzoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp/01-intro).
In general, I learnt about concept of ML with an example of prediction of car's prizes, differences between ML vs Rule-bases systems, supervised ML tasks, the CRISP-DM methodology for organizing ML projects, model selection process, and a quick recap of numpy, linear algebra and pandas.

**Thoughts:** I liked how the general concepts of ML were presented in the mlzoomcamp, which had examples for each section, and it clarified all the contents.
I already knew most of the content from recap of numpy, linear algebra and pandas, but it was a nice summary. I enjoyed with the homework, although the exercises were not very difficult. However, this review was useful to remember all the concepts that I will use later in the course and other ML projects.

## Day 2: September 11, 2021

**Today's Progress:** I have completed the first chapter of the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/).
In general, I learnt about concept the of ML, why these models are important and some examples, types of ML systems, the main challenges of ML, the importance of splitting a ML model in training, validation and test datasets, and other relevant general concepts.

**Thoughts:** It was interesting the list of main challenges of ML models and some strategies for avoiding them. Also, I realized that the best model obtained after evaluating the validation set, is trained with train+val datasets, and what is the importance of cross-validation strategy. Another interesting idea was the *No Free Lunch Theorem* because it reflect that we need to make assumptions about the data to choose a few reasonable models, instead of testing all of them. Something that I did not understant was the **train-dev set**.

## Day 4: September 13, 2021

**Today's Progress:** I watched the [first part of the lecture Traditional Feature-based Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IS7UhNMQ3U&list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn&index=4) from the Stanford's course [Machine Learning with Graphs](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/). This lecture covered the graph's features that can be used for training ML models, particularly those derived from nodes. The information-based features included node degree and some centrality measures such as eigenvector, betweenness, and closeness centralities. The structure-based features were node degree, clustering cofficient, and graphlet degree vectors. All f these features can be used for making predictions of unknown labels from certain nodes.

**Thoughts:** The lecture had a lot of useful concepts of graph features used for training ML models, particularly the node features. I enjoyed reminding some concepts of network science such as centrality measures, clustering coefficient, and graphlets. However, I am intrigued about the way by which all of these features are converted to data that the ML model can interpret.

**Today's Progress:** I commpleted the days 28 of the 30DaysOfStreamlit challenge. I learned about the streamlit-shap component for creating [shap](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) plots in streamlit apps.

**Thoughts:** It was interesting how to create appealing plots from machine learning projects in stremlit apps usin the streamlit-shap component. I will use these explainable plots in my future ML projects.

**Today's Progress:** I commpleted the day 29 of the 30DaysOfStreamlit challenge. I learned about how to create a zero-shot learning text classifier using Streamlit and HuggingFace's Distilbart-mnli-12-3 model.

**Thoughts:** It was interesting to learn about zero-shot learning, a ML strategy to recognize objects that were not observed during the training process. Also, I enjoyed learning about streamlit_option_menu, streamlit_tags, and st_aggrid streamlit components.

## Day 84: May 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I started the MLOPs Zoomcamp course, hosted by the DataTalks.Club community. I attended the first live streaming of the course, and watched the first two introductory videos about the concept of MLOPs and the environment preparation. Also, I created a streamlit dashboard for a project of my owrk about phenology information fo tropical american plant species.

**Thoughts:** It was interesting to learn about MLOPs, and the imortance of using good practices and proper tools to put ML models to production. The application of MLOPs practices allow us to automate work and create robust ML applications.
