# 100 Days Of ML Code - Log

Hi! I am Sebasti√°n, a Machine Learning enthusiast and this is my log for the 100DaysOfMLCode Challenge.

## Day 1: September 10 , 2021

**Today's Progress** : I have completed the [first week material of the mlzoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp/01-intro). 
In general, I learnt about concept of ML with an example of prediction of car's prizes, differences between ML vs Rule-bases systems, supervised ML tasks, the 
CRISP-DM methodology for organizing ML projects, model selection process, and a quick recap of numpy, linear algebra and pandas. 

**Thoughts** : I liked how the general concepts of ML were presented in the mlzoomcamp, which had examples for each section, and it clarified all the contents. 
I already knew most of the content from recap of numpy, linear algebra and pandas, but it was a nice summary. I enjoyed with the homework, although the 
exercises were not very difficult. However, this review was useful to remember all the concepts that I will use later in the course and other ML projects.
