# 100 Days Of ML Code - Log

Hi! I am Sebasti√°n, a Machine Learning enthusiast and this is my log for the 100DaysOfMLCode Challenge.

## Day 1: September 10 , 2021

**Today's Progress** : I have completed the [first week material of the mlzoomcamp](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp/01-intro). 
In general, I learnt about concept of ML with an example of prediction of car's prizes, differences between ML vs Rule-bases systems, supervised ML tasks, the 
CRISP-DM methodology for organizing ML projects, model selection process, and a quick recap of numpy, linear algebra and pandas. 

**Thoughts** : I liked how the general concepts of ML were presented in the mlzoomcamp, which had examples for each section, and it clarified all the contents. 
I already knew most of the content from recap of numpy, linear algebra and pandas, but it was a nice summary. I enjoyed with the homework, although the 
exercises were not very difficult. However, this review was useful to remember all the concepts that I will use later in the course and other ML projects.

## Day 2: September 11 , 2021

**Today's Progress** : I have completed the first chapter of the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). 
In general, I learnt about concept the of ML, why these models are important and some examples, types of ML systems, the main challenges of ML, the importance of 
splitting a ML model in training, validation and test datasets, and other relevant general concepts. 

**Thoughts** : It was interesting the list of main challenges of ML models and some strategies for avoiding them. Also, I realized that the best model obtained after evaluating the validation set, is trained 
with train+val datasets, and what is the importance of cross-validation strategy. Another interesting idea was the *No Free Lunch Theorem* because it reflect that we need to make 
assumptions about the data to choose a few reasonable models, instead of testing all of them. Something that I did not understant was the **train-dev set**.

## Day 3: September 12 , 2021

**Today's Progress** : I have completed the second chapter of the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). 
In general, I learnt about the steps followed to make a complete ML project, including understanding of the problem, data obtention, exploratory data analysis, 
data cleaning and pre-processing, feature engineering, model's training and evaluation, cross-validation, fine-tuning of model's hyperparameters, model deployment. 

**Thoughts** : This chapter was full of a lot of useful concepts and advices. Some interesting ideas an concepts were: l1 and l2 norms, sklearn classes for data 
pre-processing and pipelines, general sklearn design of classes, cross-validation, GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV, and the code examples to perform all the analysis.
