# I've joined the 100DaysOfMLCode challenge

## Overview 

**100DaysOfMLCode** is a commitment to improving my understanding of Machine Learning by dedicating at least 1 hour every day to studying and/or coding ML for 100 days.

All my progress is documented in the [log.md](log.md) file of this repo. Also, the code and projects I will be working on during this challenge will be available on this repo. 

This project is inspired by the more general [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code).
